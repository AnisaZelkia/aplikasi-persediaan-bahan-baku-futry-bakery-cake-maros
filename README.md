Application inventory on Futry Bakery And Cake Maros By Using Min-Max Method

/*
Futry Bakery & Cake Maros is a company engaged in the production of bread which is supplied to a number of distributors of bakery and cake shops in the city of Maros and the city of Makassar. The difficulty experienced by administrative staff is in controlling raw material inventory, where there is often a difference in the physical stock of raw materials in the warehouse with the stock recorded in the reporting of raw material stock. The purpose of this research is to design a web-based raw material inventory control application and implement the min-max inventory method to predict the amount of bread raw material procurement. The system design consists of 1 (one) output design, 21 (twenty one) form designs, 9 (nine) database table designs. Based on the results of system testing using the white-box testing method, the number of ciclomatyc complexity V(G), the number of regions, and the number of independent paths have the same value, namely 88. This means that all modules in the Futry Bakery & Cake Maros raw material inventory application as a whole are free from programming logic errors.
